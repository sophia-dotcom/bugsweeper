Inspired by the classic Minesweeper, this is Bugsweeper.

Just like in coding,
your goal is to find all the bugs.

**explanations of the technologies used**

**the approach taken**

**installation instructions**

**Unsolved Problems**
there may be repeats of bug locations
e.g. number of bugs is set to 15, but <15 show up on the board
