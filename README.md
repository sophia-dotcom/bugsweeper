Inspired by the classic Minesweeper, this is Bugsweeper.

With the help of values that _magically_ appear on the tiles
Estimate the bugs' hidden locations.

If you click on a tile that conceals a bug, it's GAME OVER!
Bug - 1, Player - 0.

"Don't let the bugs stop you!"
-- a wise programmer once said.
